"""Regression guard for issue #191.

On a GPU host the compiled extension ``rl_engine._C`` MUST be present and
launchable; a missing or arch-mismatched build must fail loudly here instead of
silently degrading to the pure-PyTorch fallbacks. On a CPU host (no CUDA) the
test skips, so the CPU CI job - which legitimately has no ``_C`` - stays green.

Enforcement is opt-in via ``RL_KERNEL_REQUIRE_EXT=1``, which the GPU CI
orchestrator sets right before pytest (after it has built the extension). That
way the check does not fail in environments not expected to have ``_C`` compiled -
a plain ``pytest`` run, or CI running an older orchestrator that has not built it
yet (the compiled kernels are always enforced separately by scripts/ci_smoke.py).
