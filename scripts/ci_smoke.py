"""CI fail-fast smoke check for the compiled CUDA extension (``rl_engine._C``).

Exits non-zero with a clear message when either failure mode from issue #191
occurs, so GPU CI cannot pass while silently running only native fallbacks:

  * Bug A - the extension did not build at all (e.g. PEP 517 build isolation hid
    torch from ``setup.py``), so ``from rl_engine import _C`` raises ImportError.
  * Bug B - the extension built for the wrong GPU architecture; the import
    succeeds (``dlopen`` does not check arch) but the first kernel launch raises
    ``cudaErrorNoKernelImageForDevice`` once the stream is synchronized.

Uses only ``fused_logp`` - the op registered unconditionally in ``csrc/ops.cpp`` -
so it does not require ``KERNEL_ALIGN_FORCE_SM90=1`` / a Hopper build.
